    <h1>Accessibility: Beyond The Screen-Reader</h1>

<p>Iʼd like to begin this post with a disclaimer: Iʼm not an accessibility expert. In fact, web accessibility scares me; itʼs that daunting consideration when kicking off a web project that can send shivers down the spines of the hardiest developers. Luckily, us web folk love a challenge!</p>

<p>The purpose of this post is to talk about the common misunderstanding that accessibility means catering for blind people almost exclusively. Iʼve found myself frustrated by “accessibility tunnel-vision” on a number of occasions recently which has me inspired to explain <em>my</em> understanding of web accessibility. Who exactly are we trying to cater for? Weʼll start with the obvious:</p>

<h2>Blind Or Part-Sighted Users</h2>

<p>This is the user that we tend to jump to when accessibility is mentioned. These users may rely completely on assistive technology, such as a screen-reader, to access the web. Part-sighted or vision-impaired users may not rely on a screen-reader, but will find it difficult to read content if the type is too small or cannot be zoomed.</p>

<p>There are a wealth of resources available to help make our websites work well for this group. In order to achieve a basic level of support, it helps to ensure that your website is usable in a <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/" title="The Lynx Browser">text-based browser such as Lynx</a> – writing sensible, semantic markup is a first step. I also canʼt emphasise what an eye-opener it is to <a href="http://webaim.org/articles/screenreader_testing/" title="Testing with Screen Readers: Questions and Answers">try and use a screen-reader yourself</a>.</p>

<p>Vision impaired users can be catered for by keeping your type sizes sensible (personal preference: <code>&gt;=16px</code>), and ensuring that your content is zoomable. Youʼll make this a lot easier by using a scalable font measurement in your CSS such as <code>em</code> or <code>rem</code>.</p>

<h2>Colour-Blind Users</h2>

<p>Colour-blind users may find it hard to distinguish between elements on a page if they are similar in colour. This can become a problem when the contrast between two elements is important; for example, between your website text and background. People with even mild colour-blindness may find it difficult to read content.</p>

<p>When it comes to catering for colour-blind users, subtlety becomes your enemy; there are some great <a href="http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html" title="Colour Contrast Checking Tool">contrast checking tools online</a> which can help you immensely.</p>

<h2>Users With Physical Disabilities</h2>

<p>Physical disabilities can encompass anything from minor impairments of motor-skills to paralysis. Motor impairments are common in elderly web users who may rely on a keyboard alone to browse the web – using a mouse requires small, precise hand movements.</p>

<p>Ensuring that your website is keyboard-accessible is important, itʼs also quite easy to test: unplug your mouse! There are quite a few resources around the web on this topic, and <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201104/keyboard_accessibility_again/" title="Some useful quick-tips on keyboard accessibility">fixing up your website for keyboard users</a> is actually relatively easy.</p>

<h2>Users With Cognitive Disabilities</h2>

<p>Cognitive disabilities get little air-time in my opinion, yet conditions such as dyslexia are extremely common. The diversity of this group is huge, and cognitive disabilities can have an adverse effect on memory; problem solving; attention; and reading, linguistic and verbal comprehension to name a few:</p>

<dl>

    <dt>Memory<dt>
    <dd>Some users may have difficulties with their long, mid or short-term memories. This can be an issue when moving through a stepped sign-up or purchasing process for example. Clear sign-posting and guidance is essential for these users.</dd>

    <dt>Problem solving<dt>
    <dd>For users who have trouble problem-solving, things like form errors or unclear instructions are a nightmare. Instructions should be clear and large changes to the page should be explained to the user.</dd>

    <dt>Attention</dt>
    <dd>Users with conditions such as <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr> can struggle with concentration at the best of times. Avoiding background noise on a page and using visual cues to highlight important content helps these users.</dd>

    <dt>Reading, linguistic and verbal comprehension</dt>
    <dd>This broad category ranges from problems understanding long or complex words and sentence structure, to difficulty processing non-literal text such as sarcasm, metaphor or slang. Clear document structure, supplemental media and uncomplicated writing can help these users a lot.</dd>

</dl>

<p>For more information, I can't recommend this <a href="http://webaim.org/articles/cognitive/" title="In-depth article on cognitive disabilities and the web">article on cognitive disabilities</a> enough. It goes into far more depth than I could on the subject!</p>
