    <p>I&#39;m going to talk about something which irritates me; you&#39;ll have to forgive me if I descend into a rant at first, but trust me – there&#39;s a point to this!

</p>
<p>The dressing up of technology in advertising doesn&#39;t work for me. I like to know how the product looks, feels and works in as short a time as possible. The same principals apply to web design.


</p>
<h2>Sell It To Me</h2>
<p>Think about what makes you buy a product. For me, I&#39;m attracted to a product if I believe it can make my life easier or more enjoyable in some way (and also if I think it will make me cooler… lol jk). For somebody looking for those qualities, it&#39;s important to see the key features of the product very quickly. A common theme I&#39;m seeing in tech advertising is a little worrying, there&#39;s  no attempt to build a connection between potential customers and the product in question; what I&#39;m seeing is an attempt to appeal to people&#39;s impulse and sense of &quot;cool&quot;.

</p>
<p>I can illustrate this very easily. Look at the following ad for Microsoft Surface, this is one of their launch pieces:

</p>
<iframe class="video" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/U7UlE-o8DQQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>You can also find a similar example with the <a href="http://youtu.be/dpzu3HM2CIo">Surface Teaser</a> and tentatively the <a href="http://youtu.be/F5wDYaxjbxg">Motorola RAZR M Ad</a>.

</p>
<p>What does the Surface advert tell us about the product? The answer is nothing beyond some hardware details – I know it has a keyboard and a touch screen but what can I actually do with it? How will it make my life better?

</p>
<p>As a comparison (don&#39;t stamp me with &quot;Fan-boy&quot; yet), let&#39;s look at the iPad launch ad:

</p>
<iframe class="video" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_N3TW_HA-PE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I won&#39;t make a list but from only thirty seconds of footage I know an awful lot about what the product actually does! It&#39;s exciting. They haven&#39;t even <em>really</em> focused on the hardware, because that&#39;s not what the customer cares about – the customer cares about functionality.

</p>
<p>There are other product ads that recognise this too – the <a href="http://youtu.be/6o0T44_4hb8">Samsung Galaxy S3</a> and the <a href="http://youtu.be/SbXnCQtQTWc">Nokia Lumia</a>. Notice a pattern? They are letting the product sell itself.

</p>
<p>I&#39;ll pull up one more set of examples before I apply this to web design. Web Browsers aren&#39;t particularly exciting to anyone outside of web development. However, watch this Internet Explorer advertisement and marvel at its ability to spend a whole minute <em>trying</em> to make a browser look cool:

</p>
<iframe class="video" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WA8sLsM3McU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Then watch even just one of these <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/googlechrome">Google Chrome commercials</a>. Google have a different strategy here, they stop trying to talk about the browser and look at why and how we use it. They tell some very human stories which don&#39;t try to dress up the product, In fact they avoid making their product the centre of attention at all.


</p>
<h2>So How Does This Apply To Web Design?</h2>
<p>The rights, wrongs, and near-atrocities of the highlighted adverts can be applied directly to building websites, particularly when working on a home page or landing page which is supposed to draw potential users/customers in.

</p>
<p>The mistake I see in the Microsoft Surface ads is that they focus far too much on presentation over clear information. We&#39;ve all seen this on the web before – the home page where you&#39;re not able to find the information you need because of an overly distracting visual. In the advertisements from other tablet/phone manufacturers, we&#39;re given a list of features which allow you to see the benefit of the product immediately. When designing a landing page your goal should be to deliver information to the user as quickly and efficiently as possible, not wow them with impressive visuals.

</p>
<p>With the Internet Explorer commercial, to an outsider it may not even be clear what the ad is about. They&#39;ve made the mistake of trying to make a browser look amazing to regular people, many of whom <a href="http://youtu.be/o4MwTvtyrUQ">don&#39;t even know what a browser is</a>. If you&#39;re faced with the problem of promoting a product which is not very easily understandable, then a good way to do this is to tell a story. A story can not only help someone understand an abstract concept, but can also really help them see <em>value</em> in it – they connect with the human element in a story.


</p>
<h2>To Conclude</h2>
<p>So, I probably took quite a long time to get to quite a simple point, but I thought it would be nice to illustrate the importance of user-focused design with a more &#39;real-world&#39; example (and vent a little of my personal frustration).

</p>
<p>Next time you&#39;re working on a design (or anything else targeted at customers for that matter), remember to think about the information they need before you think about ways to make your product look &#39;hip&#39; and &#39;cool&#39;. They will thank you for it, and I won&#39;t rant about it :)</p>
