# Hi there, I’m Rowan #

I’m a 24 year old Web Geek from a [beautiful little market town in the UK][ampthill]. I love to solve problems with code, and I'm currently working for [BraveNewTalent][bnt], a tech start-up in London.

I write JavaScript and CoffeeScript (but dabble in PHP and Ruby); I also get a huge kick out of clean, well-written HTML & CSS.

## More… ##

 * Good beer is a passion of mine, my favourite being [Doom Bar][doom]
 * I have a real thing for cats
 * Reading (novels and comic books) absorbs a load of my time
 * I love films that can make me think
 * [Minecraft][mc] is a terrible, terrible afflication of mine
