# Accessibility: Beyond The Screen-Reader #

I'd like to begin this post with a disclaimer: I'm not an accessibility expert. In fact, web accessibility scares me; it's that daunting consideration when kicking off a web project that can send shivers down the spines of the hardiest developers. Luckily, us web folk love a challenge!

The purpose of this post is to talk about the common misunderstanding that accessibility means catering for blind people exclusively. Talking to colleagues and other web professionals got me inspired to explain my understanding of web accessibility; who exactly are we trying to cater for? We'll start with the obvious:


## Blind Or Part-Sighted Users ##

[...]


## Colour-Blind Users ##

[...]


## Users With Physical Disabilities ##

[...]


## Users With Cognitive Disabilities ##

[...]
